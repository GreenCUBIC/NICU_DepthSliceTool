# Bagmerge
This folder contains tools and scripts used to merge the RealSense ROSBAG files and convert/encode them as different formats.

## Note
The depth encoder sets the red channel as 0, the green channel as the high byte of the 16-bit depth value, and the blue channel as the low byte of the the 16-bit depth value
